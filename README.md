# 🌍🔥 Deforestation and Fire Detection Using Satellite Data

This project aims to detect deforestation and forest fires using satellite imagery and temporal datasets. Leveraging machine learning and remote sensing techniques, the goal is to assist governments, environmental agencies, and NGOs in monitoring environmental degradation in near real-time.

## 🛰️ Project Overview

Deforestation and forest fires have severe environmental and ecological consequences. Satellite data offers an efficient way to monitor vast forest areas continuously. This project:

- Utilizes satellite data (e.g., MODIS, Landsat, or Sentinel)
- Processes and analyzes multispectral and thermal data
- Applies machine learning/deep learning models for classification/detection
- Visualizes deforestation and fire-prone areas on a geographic map

## 📊 Features

- 🔥 Forest fire detection using thermal and reflectance bands
- 🌳 Deforestation detection via NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) change over time
- 📍 Geo-mapping of high-risk zones using Folium/Leaflet or Google Earth Engine
- 🧠 Integration of ML/DL models (Random Forest, CNN, LSTM, etc.)
- 📈 Dashboard for visual analytics (optional: Streamlit/Flask web app)
